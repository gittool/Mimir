# NornicDB Transaction Implementation

## Summary

Transaction atomicity has been implemented for NornicDB storage operations.

## Implementation Details

### Files Added/Modified

1. **`pkg/storage/transaction.go`** (NEW)
   - `Transaction` struct with operation buffering
   - `CreateNode`, `UpdateNode`, `DeleteNode` - Node operations
   - `CreateEdge`, `DeleteEdge` - Edge operations  
   - `Commit()` - Apply all buffered operations atomically
   - `Rollback()` - Discard all buffered operations
   - Read-your-writes support via `GetNode()`

2. **`pkg/storage/memory.go`** (MODIFIED)
   - Added `BeginTransaction()` method to create new transactions
   - Added internal unlocked methods for atomic commit:
     - `createNodeUnlocked()`
     - `updateNodeUnlocked()`
     - `deleteNodeUnlocked()`
     - `createEdgeUnlocked()`
     - `deleteEdgeUnlocked()`

3. **`pkg/storage/transaction_test.go`** (NEW)
   - 12 comprehensive unit tests
   - 2 benchmarks

## Transaction Semantics

### What's Implemented

✅ **Atomicity** - All operations commit together or none do
✅ **Operation Buffering** - Changes are invisible until commit
✅ **Read-Your-Writes** - Transaction can see its own uncommitted changes
✅ **Rollback** - Discard all buffered operations
✅ **Closed Transaction Detection** - Error if operating on closed tx

### Usage Example

```go
engine := storage.NewMemoryEngine()
tx := engine.BeginTransaction()

// Operations are buffered, not yet visible in engine
tx.CreateNode(&Node{ID: "user-1", Labels: []string{"User"}})
tx.CreateNode(&Node{ID: "user-2", Labels: []string{"User"}})
tx.CreateEdge(&Edge{ID: "e1", StartNode: "user-1", EndNode: "user-2", Type: "FOLLOWS"})

// Read-your-writes works
node, _ := tx.GetNode("user-1")  // Returns the buffered node

// Either commit all...
err := tx.Commit()

// ...or rollback all
// tx.Rollback()
```

## Performance Benchmarks

```
BenchmarkTransaction_CommitNodes-16      129,942   10,618 ns/op   10,737 B/op   96 allocs/op
BenchmarkTransaction_RollbackNodes-16    224,329    5,403 ns/op    6,776 B/op   66 allocs/op
```

**Interpretation:**
- Committing 10 nodes takes ~10.6μs (~1μs per node)
- Rolling back 10 nodes takes ~5.4μs (faster - no storage writes)
- Memory overhead: ~1KB per node in transaction buffer

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 4.2: Bolt Integration (Not Yet Implemented)
- [ ] Connect Transaction to Bolt `handleBegin()`, `handleCommit()`, `handleRollback()`
- [ ] Store active transaction in Session struct
- [ ] Route Cypher write operations through transaction

### Phase 4.3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Snapshot isolation (prevent dirty reads from other transactions)
- [ ] Deadlock detection
- [ ] Transaction timeouts
- [ ] Savepoints

## ELI12 Explanation

Imagine you're rearranging furniture in your room:

1. **BEGIN** = "I'm going to rearrange my room"
2. **Operations** = Moving furniture around (but not committing yet)
3. **COMMIT** = "Yes! I like this arrangement, keep it!"
4. **ROLLBACK** = "Nope, put everything back where it was"

The transaction remembers where everything was before, so if you change your mind (ROLLBACK), everything goes back to the original spots!
